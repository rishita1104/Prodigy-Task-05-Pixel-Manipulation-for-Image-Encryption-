# Prodigy-Task-05-Pixel-Manipulation-for-Image-Encryption-
This project demonstrates a basic image encryption and decryption technique using pixel-level manipulation with the XOR operation. It allows users to securely scramble and recover image data using a secret key. This is a basic educational tool, not meant for high-security encryption. 
Use for learning or lightweight obfuscation.
